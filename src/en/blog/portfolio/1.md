This is the first post on the "An 11ty portfolio as soon as possible", a series which is supposed to make up the first five posts of the "Portfolio" project in my blog.

- Explain the basic Requirements

- Show design pics and stuff

Actual Process:

1. Fucked around with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/)
2. Arrange the basic layout for the article page + Some basic CSS
